# Conflicts and Conversations

[Complex adaptive systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfnY9gn6ktk) are characterised by the emergence of novel behaviours that cannot be predicted by conventional models, presenting unique challenges known as 'wicked problems'. These challenges are marked by deep uncertainty and interconnectedness, which make them difficult to define, comprehend, and resolve.  To address such complex issues, a variety of frameworks and perspectives have been employed to explore the emergent properties of these systems and uncover patterns of behaviour that can inform decision-making and interventions.


I am Adish Assain Illikkal, with a background in mathematical modelling and interdisciplinary science. Currently, I serve as a Data Science Fellow at the Data Science Innovation Hub (DSIH) at [ARTPARK-IISc](https://artpark.in/). ARTPARK focuses on translational research for social impact, bringing together data scientists, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. I'm part of the One Health Team, dedicated to developing ML-based models that provide analytical tools for effective monitoring and control of climate-sensitive diseases like dengue. Our efforts include creating a decision support system to enable government officials to make informed decisions for disease management and interventions. Additionally, I work on mechanistic disease models for scenario analyses and control strategies.


At the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), I have worked on a variety of topics involving resilience and sustainability ranging from to earth systems to socio-ecological systems under [Dr Amit Apte](https://icts.res.in/people/amit-apte).  I have used mathematical methods and concepts including dynamical systems theory, stability analysis, generalised modelling, and complex networks  in a diverse range of projects. 

During my Master's project, I developed a socio-ecological systems model to study Indian Oil Sardine population dynamics under the guidance of [Dr Steven Lade](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/meet-our-team/staff/2012-11-14-lade.html) (Researcher, Stockholm Resilience Centre) and Dr Amit Apte (Dept. of Data Science, IISER Pune). I was particularly interested in the SES framework, which accommodates feedback loops and inter-dependencies that conventional models cannot capture. We used generalised modelling and dynamical systems tools (such as bifurcation and stability analysis) to identify B-tipping points and examine the role of various social and ecological processes in the collapse of the sardine fisheries system in Kerala.


Collaboration is a cornerstone of successful research, as it fosters a creative and challenging environment where different perspectives can merge and lead to more robust and reliable results. The true strength of collaboration lies not in the mere interaction of disciplines, but in the profound and transformative connections that emerge from the friction of disparate ideas. Conflict, inevitable in such interactions, should not be feared but rather embraced as a catalyst for creative breakthroughs. The pursuit of understanding complex systems is a never-ending journey that requires constant exploration and willingness to challenge our own assumptions.


I find inspiration in the works of continental philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze. In the realm of cultural interests, I appreciate social commentary podcasts, top-class cinema, hip-hop, world music, and pre-modern aesthetics, among others.
