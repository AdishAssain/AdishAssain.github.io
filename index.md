[Complex adaptive systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfnY9gn6ktk) are characterized by the emergence of novel behaviors that cannot be predicted by conventional models, presenting unique challenges known as 'wicked problems'. These challenges are marked by deep uncertainty and interconnectedness, which make them difficult to define, comprehend, and resolve.  To address such complex issues, a variety of frameworks and perspectives have been employed to explore the emergent properties of these systems and uncover patterns of behavior that can inform decision-making and interventions.

I have a background focusing on mathematical modelling and interdisciplinary science. At the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), I have worked on a variety of topics involving resilience and sustainability ranging from to earth systems to socio-ecological systems under [Dr Amit Apte](https://icts.res.in/people/amit-apte).  I have used mathematical methods and concepts including dynamical systems theory, stability analysis, generalised modelling, and complex networks  in a diverse range of projects. 


I am interested in unraveling the mechanisms that determine the stability and resilience of complex systems. I have previously worked with Dr. Apte on the mathematical concept of the resilience of dynamical systems. I took a pluralistic approach to defining resilience(ecological resilience, engineering resilience), studying various resilience indicators used in different contexts and mathematical modeling structures (local indicators, basin-geometry indicators, and indicators based on transient dynamics). Additionally, I have studied complex network topologies and their relation to extreme events in the Indian Summer Monsoon. We employed the concept of synchronization, which provides a powerful paradigm for understanding the formation of nonlinear teleconnections in the climate system.

During my Master's project, I developed a natural resource model for a socio-ecological system under the supervision of [Dr Steven Lade](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/meet-our-team/staff/2012-11-14-lade.html) (Researcher, Stockholm Resilience Centre) and Dr Amit Apte (Dept. of Data Science, IISER Pune). I was particularly interested in the SES framework, which accommodates feedback loops and inter-dependencies that conventional models cannot capture. We used generalized modeling and dynamical systems tools (such as bifurcation and stability analysis) to identify B-tipping points and examine the role of various social and ecological processes in the collapse of the sardine fisheries system in Kerala.


Collaboration is a cornerstone of successful research, as it fosters a creative and challenging environment where different perspectives can merge and lead to more robust and reliable results. The true strength of collaboration lies not in the mere interaction of disciplines, but in the profound and transformative connections that emerge from the friction of disparate ideas. Conflict, inevitable in such interactions, should not be feared but rather embraced as a catalyst for creative breakthroughs. The pursuit of understanding complex systems is a never-ending journey that requires constant exploration and willingness to challenge our own assumptions.


I find inspiration in the works of continental philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze. In the realm of cultural interests, I appreciate social commentary podcasts, top-class cinema, hip-hop, world music, and pre-modern aesthetics, among others.
