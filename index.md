# Conflicts and Conversations

I am Adish Assain Illikkal, a masters student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), working under [Prof. Amit Apte](https://icts.res.in/people/amit-apte). I am deeply interested in integrating mathematical concepts with real-life systems (climate, social science, etc) focusing on sustainable development. Working on projects have created a deep interest in me to apply mathematical modelling for real-life scenarios, exploit data sets, infer robust information and tackle the challenges using tools from data science.


I have previously worked with Apte on the mathematical concept of the resilience of dynamical systems. I have also worked on identification of network topology from climate data to study Indian Summer Monsoon. I am also familiar with DS tools which rely on bayesianism like monte carlo markov chain (MCMC).


I like working in a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment. I believe in bridging the epistemological gap between different disciplines for collective problem solving. Conflicts arising due to difference in understanding of concepts are inevitable but it should not be barrier for constructive conversations. 


My favourite letter is C. I like a lot of words with C. I also like reading excerpts of continental philosophers like Gilles Deleuze. I am a fan of social commentary podcasts, top-class cinema, hip-hop, world music, pre-modern aesthetics.
